About
-----
The app is built as a Single Page Application using an MVC design pattern, and the Revealing Module Pattern for all JS files.
The app consists of a single table displaying the data provided for the question.
The data is retrieved on app initialization and then fed to the DataTables JS plug-in which handles the display, sorting, and filtering.
Each column can be ordered, ascending or descending, if there were more items they would be paginated, and there is a search bar which allows you to query on all columns of all rows.

Plug-ins
--------
A few plug-ins were utilized, with their assets being located in the css and vendor folders.
No set-up is required by the end user.
